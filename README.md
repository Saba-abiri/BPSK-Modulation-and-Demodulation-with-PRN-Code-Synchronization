# BPSK Modulation and Demodulation with PRN Code Synchronization

This repository contains MATLAB code for implementing a BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) modulation and demodulation system with PRN (Pseudo-Random Noise) code synchronization. The PRN code is used to find the start of the transmitted signal in the receiver, even if the received signal has been time-scaled (contracted or expanded).

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple communication system using BPSK modulation and demodulation. The transmitter modulates binary data using BPSK and appends a PRN code at the beginning of the signal for synchronization. The receiver uses cross-correlation with the PRN code to find the start of the signal and demodulates the data. The system is robust to time scaling in the received signal.

## How It Works
### Transmitter
1. Generates random binary data.
2. Appends a PRN code to the beginning of the data for synchronization.
3. Modulates the data using BPSK.
4. Broadcasts the signal using `soundsc`.

### Receiver
1. Records the transmitted signal (or loads a pre-recorded signal).
2. Uses cross-correlation with the PRN code to find the start of the signal.
3. Resamples the received signal to handle time scaling (contraction or expansion).
4. Demodulates the BPSK signal to recover the original data.
5. Calculates the bit error rate (BER) to evaluate performance.

## Usage

### Transmitter
1. Open the `transmitter.m` script in MATLAB.
2. Set the parameters (e.g., carrier frequency, sampling frequency, data rate).
3. Run the script to generate and broadcast the BPSK-modulated signal.
4. The transmitted signal and parameters are saved in `transmitted_signal.mat`.

### Receiver
1. Open the `receiver.m` script in MATLAB.
2. Load the recorded signal (e.g., `recorded_signal.wav`).
3. Load the transmitted signal parameters from `transmitted_signal.mat`.
4. Run the script to demodulate the signal and calculate the bit error rate.

## Dependencies
- MATLAB (tested on R2021a or later)
- Signal Processing Toolbox (for `resample` and `xcorr` functions)

---

## Results
- The receiver successfully synchronizes with the transmitted signal using the PRN code.
- The demodulated data is compared with the original data to calculate the bit error rate (BER).
- Example output:
Original Data: [1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 ...]
Demodulated Data: [1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 ...]
Bit Error Rate: 0.02
